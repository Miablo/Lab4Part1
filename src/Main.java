/**
 *
 * A function foo takes three integers as input arguments, i.e., foo(int a, int b, int c).
 * The three inputs represent the three sides of a triangle in centimeter.
 * The function is expected to return the type of a triangle: “equilateral”, “isosceles”, or “scalene”.
 * Assume the domains of the three variables are 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, 50 ≤ b ≤ 150 and 100 ≤ c ≤ 200, respectively.
 * A test case is in a tuple format <a, b, c, expected_output> with test inputs and the expected output.
 *
 * S1 is a set of test cases for the “Boundary Value Analysis” approach. (0.5 pt)
 *
 * S1 =

 * S2 is a set of test cases for the “Robustness testing” approach. (0.5 pt)
 *
 * S2 – S1 =

 * S3 is a set of tests cases for the “Robust Worst-Case testing” approach.
 * Are there any types of triangles that S3 cannot reveal?
 * If yes, what are they? If no, why? (1 pt)
